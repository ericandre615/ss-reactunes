          Guided by Voices (GBV) is an American indie rock band formed in 1983 in Dayton, Ohio
          It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter Robert Pollard.
          The most well-known lineup of the band consisted of Pollard (lead vocals),
          his brother Jim (guitar, bass), Mitch Mitchell (lead guitars), Tobin Sprout (vocals, rhythm guitars), Kevin Fennell (drums),
          and bassist Greg Demos. Noted at first for their lo-fi aesthetic and typically
          Portastudio four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices&apos;
          music was influenced by early postâ€“British Invasion garage rock, psychedelic rock,
          progressive rock, punk rock and post-punk. Due to their prolific output,
          releasing 30 full-length albums along with many other releases, they have garnered a dedicated
          cult following with songs that are in the two-minute range,
          with many which are even shorter. Their songs are also known for ending abruptly or intertwining with
          odd and homemade sound effects.

          Guided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004. In 2010 the &quot;classic&quot; lineup reunited to perform at Matador Records 21st anniversary party,
          subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in 2014,
          but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in 2016.

          Dream on, child of change
          <br />
          Throw your javelin through the sun
          <br />
          Pierce the heart of everyone
          <br />
          Though we push to slave the days
          <br />
          This is not reality
          <br />
          This is just formality
          <br />
          The cup is only being filled
          <br />
          For the chance to have it spilled
          <br />
          Flowing just like the days
          <br />
          Sailing just like the days
          <br />
          Flowing just like the days
          <br />
          Sailing just like the days
          <br />
